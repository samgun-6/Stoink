# Stoink

Stoink for stock price prediction is a system that uses deep learning LSTM model to predict the price increase or decrease of one or more stocks for the next three months.

## Functionality 
The client aims to present the option of using our model to predict what the increase or decrease in percentage is going to be of a certain stock or multiple stocks. This can be done in different ways, either the user inputs values manually and gets the prediction for those values or presses a button which runs all stocks in the system through the model and predicts which ones are predicted to have the most increase (the data which is ran through the model is the latest balance sheet report for each company). This is presented in a list, sorted in descending order. There will also be a list of stocks if the user just wants to make a prediction on a single stock, that is in the system. Admin can extract datasets from the API in the admin page to train the model with new data.
